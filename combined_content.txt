 UEA Background 
The Uganda Evaluation Association (UEA)was formed in May 2001 and registered in 2002 as a professional association and national chapter of the African Evaluation Association:
 The Uganda Evaluation Association (UEA)was formed in May 2001 and registered in 2002 as a professional association and national chapter of the African Evaluation Association: Create a national network to facilitate sharing of literature methods, procedure and practical evaluation frameworks among evaluators who were operating in isolation. Build capacity for evaluation Promote professionalism in evaluation practice. 
Although these objectives have been refined over the years, they remain largely the same. The Association started with a membership of over fifty individuals drawn from monitoring and evaluation units in Government, Parastatals, local and international NGOs, private organizations and members from the public that are engaged in evaluation practice. A steering committee of prominent evaluators was appointed to translate the objectives of the association into feasible strategies and activities. The Committee comprised of Mr. Ismail Barugahare as the National Coordinator, Mr. Chris Opondo from the African Highlands Ecoregional Programme, Dr. Sophy Musana from NARO, Dr. Edward Mukooyo from the Ministry of Health, Ms. Susan Kasedde from UNICEF and Mrs. Margaret Kakande Head Poverty Monitoring and Analysis Unit MFPED. Dr. Z. Nyiira was an advisor to the group. I joined the Steering group one year later in 2003.

 YEEs Uganda The YEEs program is an initiative implemented by the Uganda Evaluation Association (UEA) where a group of young and emerging evaluators will work together to achieve their career purposes and objectives in evaluations. It operates as a network for the young and emerging evaluators under the sponsorship/ support of UEA and other partners.  Interested members will be considered as members, with ability to activate their core group membership at any stage with UEA. 
 Partnership members may be members who may or may not be active but are involved in specifically as representatives of organizations and networks with a primary view to sharing of information rather than engaging directly in activities. Young and Emerging Evaluators (YEEs) will be individuals who are members of UEA and meet at least one of the following criteria: Evaluators who have less than 5 years of professional experience, or Recent university graduates (5 years or less post-graduation) who are interested in joining the evaluation profession, or Development professionals who have relevant technical knowledge and, within the past 5 years or less, have expressed an interest in becoming professional evaluators.

 Univertisty Chapters 
One of the approaches to popularizing the YEEs program is through establishment of University Chapters. University Chapters under this program are composed of M&E active students and those that completed but are either wish to continue participating through the University and qualify as Young and Emerging Evaluators. With guidance from UEA, chapters conduct capacity building activities aligned to the strategic plan and work plan of the UEA. Currently two chapters are operations, that is, UMU Chapter and UMI Mbale Chapter. Details to these can be found under the university chapters section.

 The Budget Monitoring and Accountability Unit (BMAU) was established in July 2008 to enhance monitoring efforts geared towards effective implementation of government programmes and projects. Budget monitoring is concerned with tracking implementation of selected government programs or projects observing how values of different indicators against stated goals and targets change over time. 
Budget monitoring seeks to verify information in the quarterly performance reports and assess the link between and physical performance. Monitoring focuses on the sector indicators that are listed in the budget framework papers, categorized into short term, medium term and long term indicators as well as verifying the link between information provided in the quarterly performance reports; and financial and physical performance. This information is released in budget monitoring reports and policy briefs. The Budget Directorate at the Ministry of Finance uses the information to engage with spending agencies on performance issues, and each sector is required to submit a written response explaining areas of under-performance.

 Strategic Plan 2021 - 2025 It is a pleasure to unveil the third Strategic Plan of the Uganda Evaluation Association (UEA) for the five year period 2021 to 2025. The Association was formed in 2001 as a National Chapter of the African Evaluation Association (AFREA). We have grown from a membership base of below 50 in 2002 to close to 400, including affiliated institutions and interested evaluators. We aim to ensure excellent evaluation management in Uganda’s development process. Thus we are committed to promote the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) practice and use, through advocacy and capacity building and promoting partnerships among key evaluation and development actors. By the end of the plan period, we target to establish a community of practice that effectively influences evaluation management and use in the country. 
 
 We have a strong and committed Executive Committee that will oversee the effective implementation of this Plan; Mr. Matthew Lubuulwa – President; Mrs. Josephine Watera – Vice President; Ms. Annette k. Mutoni – Treasurer; Mrs. Christine Abong – General Secretary; Mr. Vicent Ssenyondo – Asst. General Secretary; Ms. Nacwa Shakira – YEEs representative, Mr. Christopher Mayanja - UMI representative; Dr. James Wokadala - representative Academia, Mr Mathius Mulumba - Executive Member.  In its work, the Executive is supported by the Administrator. 
 
 We look forward to work with all key evaluation stakeholders in the public and private sector, civil society and academia in Uganda; African Evaluation Association (AFREA); regional and international bodies and development partners to improve the livelihoods of our people through professional evaluation. 
 
 Matthew Lubuulwa 
 President Uganda Evaluation Association

 UEA Background 
The Uganda Evaluation Association (UEA)was formed in May 2001 and registered in 2002 as a professional association and national chapter of the African Evaluation Association:
 The Uganda Evaluation Association (UEA)was formed in May 2001 and registered in 2002 as a professional association and national chapter of the African Evaluation Association: Create a national network to facilitate sharing of literature methods, procedure and practical evaluation frameworks among evaluators who were operating in isolation. Build capacity for evaluation Promote professionalism in evaluation practice. 
Although these objectives have been refined over the years, they remain largely the same. The Association started with a membership of over fifty individuals drawn from monitoring and evaluation units in Government, Parastatals, local and international NGOs, private organizations and members from the public that are engaged in evaluation practice. A steering committee of prominent evaluators was appointed to translate the objectives of the association into feasible strategies and activities. The Committee comprised of Mr. Ismail Barugahare as the National Coordinator, Mr. Chris Opondo from the African Highlands Ecoregional Programme, Dr. Sophy Musana from NARO, Dr. Edward Mukooyo from the Ministry of Health, Ms. Susan Kasedde from UNICEF and Mrs. Margaret Kakande Head Poverty Monitoring and Analysis Unit MFPED. Dr. Z. Nyiira was an advisor to the group. I joined the Steering group one year later in 2003.

 YEEs Uganda The YEEs program is an initiative implemented by the Uganda Evaluation Association (UEA) where a group of young and emerging evaluators will work together to achieve their career purposes and objectives in evaluations. It operates as a network for the young and emerging evaluators under the sponsorship/ support of UEA and other partners.  Interested members will be considered as members, with ability to activate their core group membership at any stage with UEA. 
 Partnership members may be members who may or may not be active but are involved in specifically as representatives of organizations and networks with a primary view to sharing of information rather than engaging directly in activities. Young and Emerging Evaluators (YEEs) will be individuals who are members of UEA and meet at least one of the following criteria: Evaluators who have less than 5 years of professional experience, or Recent university graduates (5 years or less post-graduation) who are interested in joining the evaluation profession, or Development professionals who have relevant technical knowledge and, within the past 5 years or less, have expressed an interest in becoming professional evaluators.
